### 🚀 About Me


Heyy its Youcef, this is everything you need to know about me!


📈I've been partaking in a DevOps Bootcamp called CoderCo for a few months now and the amount of learning I've managed to accumilate is way beyond what I thought I was capable of.


😅Another thing that never fails to amaze me is also how far I've gone from not knowing what an IP Address was to being able to deploy an application to my ECS + route it to my Route 53. 


🛠️Getting my hands dirty with projects has truly shown me the reality of being a DevOps Engineer, turning an instruction covering 1-2 lines to a complex infrastructure that carries out exactly what's needed.
